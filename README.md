## Project Description

    The motive of this assignment is to learn and implement AI libraries to get coordinates of any given rectangle drawn on whiteboard.

## Problem Statement
     Write a program which recognizes human whiteboard drawn rectangles in images and prints rectangle bounds (x, y, width, height).
     The program should be able to understand not only attached images, but similarly drawn new ones as well.
	Input: image with human whiteboard drawn rectangles (see attachments).
	Output: bounds (x, y, width, height) of every rectangle found in an image.



## Technology used

	'HTML' and 'CSS' to display on browser, 'JavaScript' language is used to write the code and Opencv.js to use its libraries and methods.

## Requirements

    1. Must have an IDE and Opencv.js downloaded.
    2. Need multiple image files to test working of code.
    
## Steps to run assignment
